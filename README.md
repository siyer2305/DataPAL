# DataPAL

DataPal is an intelligent conversational AI agent that enables natural language interactions with your structured data. It helps users derive insights and create visualizations from their data through simple conversations. Built as an agentic SQL RAG implementation, DataPal can automatically generate database schemas, provide table listings, and intelligently query relevant tables based on natural language questions.

The application allows users to easily import data by uploading CSV or Excel files, which are automatically processed and stored in a database. Users maintain full control over their data through comprehensive table management features, allowing them to specify which tables should be included when generating insights and visualizations.

Perfect for data analysts, business users, and anyone looking to explore their data through natural conversation, DataPal bridges the gap between complex data structures and intuitive data exploration.

## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siyer2305/DataPAL.git
   cd DataPal
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   The application uses Anthropic's Claude LLMs as the chat models. If you wish to use Claude, generate an API key for the Anthropic console by visiting [Anthropic's Console](https://console.anthropic.com/). Feel free to use other LLM providers such as OpenAI, Google, Groq etc. You will have to configure the code accordingly to suit the provider. The application also uses E2B, which provides sandboxed environments to run Python code generated by the LLM to create visualizations. The API key for E2B can be generated by signing up for their services at [their website](https://e2b.dev/). 
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   E2B_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   # Add other environment variables as needed
   ```

5. **Run the application**

   The AI agent was built using LangGraph, a powerful framework for creating AI agents using concepts of graphs and nodes. The documentation for LangGraph can be found [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/). It provides a Python SDK which makes it easy to integrate the AI agent with the web application.

   To start a server of LangGraph on your local machine using the terminal: 
   
   ```powershell
   langgraph dev
   ```  
   
   Note: This command creates a developer server that is not suitable for production use. For production use, follow the instructions in the [LangGraph documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) for deploying agents created using LangGraph.

   The web application was built using FastAPI, a powerful Python framework for creating web applications. It uses uvicorn, an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server to create web applications.

   To run the web application:
   ```powershell
   cd app/src
   uvicorn fast_app:app --reload
   ```
