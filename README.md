# DataPAL

DataPal is an intelligent conversational AI agent that enables natural language interactions with your structured data. It helps users derive insights and create visualizations from their data through simple conversations. Built as an agentic SQL RAG implementation, DataPal can automatically generate database schemas, provide table listings, and intelligently query relevant tables based on natural language questions.

The application allows users to easily import data by uploading CSV or Excel files, which are automatically processed and stored in a database. Users maintain full control over their data through comprehensive table management features, allowing them to specify which tables should be included when generating insights and visualizations.

Perfect for data analysts, business users, and anyone looking to explore their data through natural conversation, DataPal bridges the gap between complex data structures and intuitive data exploration.

## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siyer2305/DataPAL.git
   cd DataPal
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**\n
   The application uses Anthropic's Claude LLMs as the chat models. If you wish to use Claude, generate an API key for the Anthropic console by visiting [Anthropic's Console](https://console.anthropic.com/). Feel free to use other LLM providers such as OpenAI, Google, Groq etc. You will have to configure the code accordingly to suit the provider. The application also uses E2B, which provides sandboxed environments to run Python code generated by the LLM to create visualizations. The API key for E2B can be generated by signing up for their services at [their website](https://e2b.dev/). 
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   E2B_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   # Add other environment variables as needed
   ```

4. **Run the application**\n
   The application is built using Streamlit, a powerful Python framework for creating web applications with minimal code. Streamlit makes it easy to create interactive data applications without extensive knowledge of web development.

   To run the Streamlit application:
   ```powershell
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
